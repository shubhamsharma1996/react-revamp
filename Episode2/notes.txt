//React Element
const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Hi My name is shubham</h1>;

//React Component
const HeadingComoponent = () =>(
    <h1 id="heading">Hi My name is shubham and this is a functional component.</h1>
)


//React Component are of two types
/**
 * Class Based Component - Old way to create
 * Functional component - New way to create ( a normal function which return jsx)
 */

//component composition - means to include another component in the component.
 const TitleComponent = () =>(
   <h1 className="title"> React Component </h1>
)
const HeadingComoponent = () =>(
   <div id='container'>
      {TitleComponent()}
      <TitleComponent />
      <TitleComponent><TitleComponent />
      <h2 id="heading">Hi My name is shubham and this is a functional component.</h2>
   </div>
)

we can write any js code inside components by using "{}" paranthesis.

we can call the component by these three types:
-->   {TitleComponent()}
-->    <TitleComponent />
-->   <TitleComponent><TitleComponent />
 
JSX sanatize the data and it prevents Cross Site scripting attack.
