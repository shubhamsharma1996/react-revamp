React do efficient DOM manipulation.

Whenever a state variable updates react will rerender the component.

React use Reconciliation Algorithm which is also know as React Fiber.

Virtual Dom - It is a representation of a actual DOM. it is in form of object.

==> Diffing Algorithm - whenever a state variable update react reconcile the old Virtual DOM with New Virtual DOM and 
              check the difference and then update the Actual DOM.
